# Illidan Quiz


## Project overview 


### To creat a timed quiz using javascript

- Use a timer and present questions
- When a question is answered, another question is presented
- When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted
- When all questions are answered or when the timer hits 0, the quiz is over
- When the game is over, the user can save their score and initials

### Tools used in creating site
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Stackoverflow

### Issues resolved
- Questions were presented after previous question was answered
- Initials and Score werent being stored into local storage
- Local storage would delete old results and replace with new one
- Was using one HTML and one JS file for entire project, then switch to seperate for main and highscore page.
